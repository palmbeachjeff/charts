# Highcharts project

I wanted to use Highcharts to display the data of a for-profit university on a static page.  In order to use accurate data, I used MacroTrends.net for the stock data and exported it into a Googlesheet. 

The Google Sheet can be seen here and changing the fields would dynamically change the chart itself.  

Next steps:
1.) Host on AWS
2.) Add competitors charts as well
